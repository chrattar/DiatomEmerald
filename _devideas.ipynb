    "#### Base Ideas\n",
    "* Base particles with brownian motion\n",
    "* Have the particles eat food from the environment that is randomly generated\n",
    "* Initial particles will be based on Brownian motion, but later animals should have some sort of direction in order to move toward food and away from predatory entities.\n",
    "* I want to make a static organism like a hydra\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Food\n",
    "\n",
    "* Food for the particle to eat. - Eating is required to stay alive\n",
    "* Create a timer for resource use for the particles. As they exist, they slowly use energy. If they do not get food after a certain number of iterations in the program, they will die. The body could eventually convert to food for another particle\n",
    "* Need to set up the timer for the class before they disappear\n",
    "* need to make a class in def main to update the particle every iteration before it is drawn to the screen.\n",
    "* Should the food disappear after a time after it randomly spawns?\n",
    "* How do i group the food to take advantage of different environments\n",
    "#### Size Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environment and Map Area\n",
    "* Make the map scrollable to allow for a larger area to be explored by the organisms\n",
    "* How do we set the environmental conditions? Have the entities have an internal temperature\n",
    "* Hydrothermal vent areas at later point. Stimulate more intense evolutionary processes\n",
    "* Environmental Mutation factors - certain areas will have stronger environmental stimuli\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Animals\n",
    "* Number of animals to add? Initially just random particles that would exist on diatoms or something similar.\n",
    "* Mutations from environmental factors (radiation) but also random mutations inside the animals\n",
    "* Adjust the rate of the energy consumption. Different animals will have different rates. Larger animals burn energy at a lower rate, but have less movement."
